# Text-classification-from-scratch

###  Introduction
In this we will do text classification starting from raw text (as a set of text files on disk). We demonstrate the workflow on the IMDB sentiment classification dataset (unprocessed version). We use the TextVectorization layer for word splitting & indexing.

### Project Overview
* Dataset: IMDB Sentiment Classification Dataset (unprocessed).  
* Task: Binary Sentiment Classification (positive/negative).    
* Key Components:  
> Text vectorization layer for word splitting and indexing.  
End-to-end text classification workflow.


Objectives:
* Demonstrate text classification using raw text data.  
* Showcase TextVectorization layer capabilities.  
* Provide a reproducible example for sentiment analysis tasks.

### Conclusion:
The trained model demonstrates satisfactory performance on the task, with an accuracy exceeding 86%. The relatively low loss value indicates effective optimization during training. These results suggest that the model is well-suited for classification tasks, providing a reliable foundation for further refinement or deployment.
